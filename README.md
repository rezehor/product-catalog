# Product Catalog API Service üõí

## Description
Product Catalog API Service is a web-based platform that allows users to manage and search products via saved filters. Built with FastAPI and MongoDB (Beanie + Motor), this system provides a scalable and extensible API for product and filter management. It supports CRUD operations for products and filters, as well as searching products using saved filters. The entire system is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
